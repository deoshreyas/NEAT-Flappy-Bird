# NEAT-Flappy-Bird

## :zap: About
This is basically Flappy Bird, but instead of the user playing, the computer learns to do so using Neural Networks and a _neat_ technique called NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). This is basically a simulation of natural selection in a computer program, where good genetics help the subsequent generation to play better.

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and run `main.py`. You might need to install a few packages.

- The creators of the NEAT-Python for simplifying everything so well. Also for amazing documentation!
